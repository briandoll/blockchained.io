There is a lot of hype around bitcoin and the blockchain that enables it. I wanted to better understand what core use cases people were solving based on the blockchain. There are countless speculation, news and prediction blogs/sites. This is not one of them. There are also sites that catalog all the bitcoin/blockchain startups. This is also not that.

Blockchain.io aims to show what the blockchain is being used for, in hopes to spur the next great blockchain-enabled idea.
