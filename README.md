### Blockchain.io

This site aims to give a quick glimpse into the ecocystem built on the blockchain. I wanted to be able to quickly see what sort of use cases were enabled by the blockchain, and who the big players were in each space. This is that website.

### Contributing

I'd love your contributions! Feel free to:

* Open an issue and tell me what you think should be added/removed/changed
* Better yet, open a pull request and submit the change
* Send me [an email](mailto:brian@emphaticsolutions.com) if you'd rather do that
* Suggest a better visualization. I used [Springy](http://getspringy.com) because it worked quickly, but there's lots not to like about it
